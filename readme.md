<h1>Ugo.js</h1>
<p>So I wanted to refresh my knowledge of pure javascript by writing my next project without React, but eventualy I ended up writing my own little frontend library with virtual dom.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>If you want to try it out just clone it with "git clone https://github.com/ugo-h/ugojs". It's syntax is similar to React without jsx.</p>
<h2>Future advancements</h2>
<p>Because of a toy nature of this project I dont't plan any improvements in future, however it would be cool to add jsx support.</p>
